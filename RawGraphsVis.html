            <p> <strong>Figure 1</strong> shows a tree map data visualization of orchestra instruments.  Each category
              of orchestra instruments (i.e., strings, percussion, woodwinds) is assigned a rectangle area with 
              subcategory rectangles of instrument counts in each category.  These are further grouped by orchestra
              type (i.e., modern, early romantic, classical).  By looking at this data visualization, it's easy to 
              see how string instruments tend to make up the vast majority of orchestras with similar proportions of 
              percussion, woodwinds, and keyboards seen throughout.

            <p><strong>Figure 2</strong> shows a bump chart data visualization of alien species record counts by 
                continent.  The vertical thickness of the line as you go across years corresponds to the magnitude
                of alien species record counts.  By looking at this, it appears that Europe has a significantly higher
                magnitude of alien record counts when compared to places such as Asia or Africa. </p>

            <p><strong>Figure 3</strong> shows a data visualization depicting data from GoodReads on the top ten 
                according to number of ratings.  A circle packing chart was used to visualize the different books 
                along with the author, average rating, and total number of ratings dispalyed in each circle.  The 
                size of the circles corresponds to the number of ratings, with colors corresponding to the book 
                title (see legend on right).  By looking at this, it's apparent that Stephanie Meyer's Twilight 
                has the most ratings for books on GoodReads while J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of 
                Azkaban has the highest average rating.
