                <p> As planet Earth continues to undergo drastic change due to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the need to understand and predict how climate change will impact the planet has never been greater.  A quick Google of the words "Climate Change", will result in a barrage of articles spanning from positive to negative, scientific to opinion, and even from fact to fiction.  While many of the reports and articles surrounding the topic of climate change can seem disheartening, there's a bright spot emerging that has the potential to revolutionize the way we study and understand the many changes happening across Earth. 

                This bright spot can be found amongst scrolling lines of code, from ground sensors measuring temperature to satellites thousands of miles away in space collecting imagery.  From one computer connecting to many others from all around the globe with knowledge and information being shared and transformed through the power of mathematics, physics, and statistics:
                
                
                This bright spot is found in the world of Big Data and Data Science.
