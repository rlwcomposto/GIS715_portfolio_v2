            <p> <strong>Figure 1</strong> shows a map of airports and flight paths between them.  The point of this
                visualization was to demonstrate the use of live layer effects in map design.  A drop-shadow effect
                was applied to the airport symbols, and an outer glow effect was applied to the flight paths to make
                them stand out more in front of the dark background.  Stroke widths and opacity levels were adjusted
                to create the desired effect and overall map design seen above.

            <p><strong>Figure 2</strong> shows a bathymetry map for the world.  The main point of this visualization
            was to practice using the live layer effect Mulitply for all of the elevation layers.  This resulted in the 
            almost cut out or wood carved look seen in the map.  This type of layer blending is particularly useful 
            for data pertaining to elevation or depth. </p>

            <p><strong>Figure 3</strong> shows a map depicting a hillshade overlaid with land ownership, 
            township boundaries and rivers.  The main point of this visualization was to further explore 
            different blending modes and layer renderings to create unique effects using a Digital 
            Elevation Model (DEM).  The DEM was first rendered as a hillshade and then the land ownership 
            and township data were added using the Multiply and Overlay blending modes respectfully. </p>

            <p><strong>Figure 4</strong> shows the same map as in Figure 3, however this time labels are 
            added to the township boundaries and stylized so that they contain a white background rendered
            with the soft light blending mode.  The labels are also set within the map in a way that makes it
            so they do not overlap or intersect with the legend or logo also contained within the map. </p>

            <p><strong>Figure 5</strong> shows a map of road networks in Denmark.  The point of this figure 
            was to use the Addition blending mode for a feature in order to depict areas of high density with 
            a lighter color compared to areas of lower density which are depicted with the darker blue color. 
            This style works especially well for maps and visualizations that have a dark background. </p>

            <p><strong>Figure 6</strong> shows a map of the United States.  The point of this figure was
            to create a map style that has commonly been used in history and in atlas depictions of the 
            United States in a quick and easy way.  The Topological Coloring Tool was used in order to 
            render the states different colors.  Then, the shape boundaries were rendered using the 
            Shapeburst blending effect and overlaid on top of the colors.  Next, the state boundaries were
            rendered using the Outline: Marker Line effect in oreder to generate random dots surrounding 
            the state borders.  The layers were combined using a vareity of opacity settings in order to 
            create the desired effect seen in the figure above. </p>

            <p><strong>Figure 7</strong> shows a map of the Alligator River area located in Eastern 
            North Carolina.  This is a set of my own data that I had previously used to generate a 
            figure for the NASA FINESST proposal solicitation.  To generate this figure, I used the same 
            tools and blending effects used to create the Bathymetry and Jemez maps.  My digital 
            elevation model (DEM) was rendered as a hillshade layer, and then the National Land Cover
            2019 (NLCD, 2019) dataset was overlaid on top and blended using the Multiply blending mode.  
            Opacity levels were rendered in order to create the desired effect seen in the above figure.</p>
